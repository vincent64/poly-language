¦ The Stack interface describes an abstract LIFO stack structure.
¦ It contains methods to push and pop object, as well as to get the object on top.

interface+ Stack(Deque) {

    ¦ Pushes the given object on top of the stack.
    ¦ @param the object
    ¦
    fn void push(Object obj);

    ¦ Pops the topmost object off the stack and returns it.
    ¦ @returns the topmost object
    ¦
    fn Object pop();

    ¦ Pops the n topmost objects off the stack and returns them in a list.
    ¦ @param the object count
    ¦ @returns the topmost objects list
    ¦
    fn List pop(int count) {
        assert(0 <= count && count <= size());

        List list = new ArrayList();
        for(int i = 0; i < count; i++)
            list.add(pop());

        return list;
    }

    ¦ Returns the topmost object.

    ¦ The StackOverflowException is thrown when the stack reaches
    ¦ its maximum capacity when attempting to push an element.
    ¦
    exception~ StackOverflowException {
        fn~ constructor() super("The stack has reached its maximal capacity");
    }

    ¦ The StackUnderflowException is thrown when the stack is empty
    ¦ and there is an attempt to pop or peek an element.
    ¦
    exception~ StackUnderflowException {
        fn~ constructor() super("The stack is empty.");
    }
}

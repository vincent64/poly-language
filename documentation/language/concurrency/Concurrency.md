# Concurrency

> Concurrency in Poly is not yet implemented.
> The only way to work with concurrency as of today is to use Java's concurrency classes.
> 
> Concurrency is a very important and delicate feature that must and will be added to Poly.
> I would like concurrency to be easy to use, and most importantly, be integrated into the language.
> 
> However, I don't feel like I have enough experience with concurrency to provide the right
> features and tools. For now, I have reserved the keywords `async`, `await` and `thread` in the language,
> to be able to give them a meaning (if needed) without breaking the users' current code.
> 
> If you consider yourself a developer with a good grasp on concurrency, be it
> in any language such as Java, JavaScript, etc. and have ideas on how to incorpore it to the language,
> make sure to write a suggestion thread in the **Issues** tab of the GitHub page.
> Make sure to have some project where you can show off your skills in concurrency,
> in order to provide some examples of what you're capable of.
> You don't have to provide technical details on how to add the features inside the compiler,
> that's my task.
> 
> **Note :** Poly doesn't support `native` methods like Java do, and is currently not a planned feature.
> The way Poly would provide concurrency support would be through Java classes,
> like `Thread`.

# The Poly programming language

**Poly** is a high-level, objet-oriented, general purpose programming language that is currently in development.
It is strongly and statically typed, and features type inference.
Poly code is designed to be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
thus making it memory-safe, garbage-collected and interoperable with Java, Kotlin and Scala.

Code written in Poly is meant to be familiar, modern and elegant.
One of the core feature of Poly is to reduce the boilerplate and verbosity of traditional object-oriented languages,
while still making it friendly and easy to learn for beginners and professionnals alike.

The Poly programming language contains most of the features from every highly-used programming languages,
as well as new and unique features.

The Poly programming language was invented and designed by Vincent Philippe (@vincent64).

> The **Poly programming language** is currently in its early phase.
> This means language features can be added, updated or removed at any time,
> as well as standard library features.
> 
> If you notice a bug when compiling your code, please raise an issue.
> If you want to improve the language or suggest a feature, please do so in the _Issues_ tab.
> New class suggestions or implementations for the standard library are more than welcome!

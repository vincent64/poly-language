# Contributing
Although the Poly programming language is a personnal project, contributions such as bug reports and propositions are welcome.
Every issue is managed through the official GitHub repository.

The **Discussions** tab on the GitHub repository can be used to discuss potential new features or feature ideas,
as well as bugs and issues, before making an issue report.
